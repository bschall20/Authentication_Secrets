# Authentication_Secrets

A website for your secrets to be uploaded made with HTML + CSS + JavaScript and EJS + ExpressJS + Mongoose!
Register with a fake (or real!) email + username and then sign in with it on the login page. 
Submit a secret, then make a new account and login to see the secret posted! 
The goal of this course was to use .env files and authentication and play with OAuth 2.0 + Google sign in pages!

It can be accessed by downloading and running with Nodemon in your terminal!

Made in Angela's Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
*Projects uploaded from Angela's course are my own work with reference to hers (mainly the CSS). 
          The course follows a structure where you're given a challenge and told to code it based on the module.
          These uploads from the course are my work where I then used the course to critique and correct mine (if needed only as a last resort)
